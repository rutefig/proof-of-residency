# Proof of Residency

**Proof of Residency** enables users to generate a verifiable proof of residency from an email with an ATCud-signed utility bill (available in Portugal). The project leverages cryptographic techniques to preserve privacy, ensuring that while the country of residence is publicly verifiable, sensitive details like the specific address remain private.

By relying on trusted email sources—such as government communications, utility bills, or legal contracts, this project minimizes reliance on traditional and invasive verification methods.

## Features

- **Email-based verification:** Uses trusted emails (e.g., from government agencies or utility companies) as the basis for proof of residency.
- **Privacy preservation:** Keeps specific address details private while publicly verifying only the country of residence.
- **Recipient verification:** Ensures the email recipient is the individual proving residency.
- **Onchain:** Supports cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation.

## How it works

### Components

The Proof of Residency project employs the following technologies:

- **[zkEmail](https://github.com/zkemail)**: confirms that the email was sent to the claimed email address.
- **[ATCud](https://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/Faturacao/Comunicacao_Series_ATCUD/Paginas/default.aspx)** signature for documents 
- **[SP1](https://docs.succinct.xyz/)**: Extracts and verifies document signatures from emails with attached PDFs; generates proof.
- **[Hylé](https://docs.hyle.eu/)**: Adds verifiability to residency proofs.

### Step by step

1. **Submit an email**: Upload an email (e.g., a utility bill or government communication) as proof of residence.
2. **Generate proof**: Use the system to parse attached PDFs, extract necessary data, and generate a privacy-preserving proof of residency.
3. **Share the proof**: Provide verifiable proof to third parties while keeping sensitive details private.
